If an HTML tag is opened within another, for example the body tag is opened inside the html tag, then that tag(body) must close before the outter(html) tag is closed. We ended the body tag first because it was opened most recently. This rule of 'closing the most recent tag before closing older tags' applies to all HTML tags.",
